Ever wondered what users love or hate about a product - not just whether they like it?

I built a lightweight Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA) engine in pure Java 8 that:
✅ Detects key aspects (e.g., camera, battery, display) from reviews
✅ Matches sentiment words ("awesome", "worse", "ok") to the correct aspect using linguistic proximity
✅ Outputs structured ratings (1–5 scale) per feature

🛠️ Tech: Java 8 Streams, HashMap optimizations, regex tokenization — no external NLP libraries!
